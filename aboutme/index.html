   <h2>Evan Floyd</h2>
   <p>Hey everyone! I am Evan and this is my fourth semester here at BYUI. I am studying to complete my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and I am very excited to learn about web design.
    I was born in SLC Utah, but grew up in Denver Colorado. My family and I moved to Middleton Idaho about nine years ago and I loved it. My family currently resides in Pocatello Idaho and I live in Rexburg while I am attending school. I have three younger brothers and one older sister, so that makes me the second oldest.
    I don't know much about coding and different programing languages, but I am excited to learn how they work and apply them into my future career.
   </p>

            What is a JDM Car?
        </h3>
        <p>
            To answer this question in short, JDM is short for Japanese Domestic Market. These are cars that originated in Japan and have since be manufactured all over the world. You may have heard of several brands of JDM cars including Toyota, Subaru, Mazda, and Honda. These are all big-time car manufacturers all over the world, but you might be wondering what makes specific JDM car models from the 1990s-2000s so rare and sought after?

            The answer is supply and demand. The supply for those specific types of vehicles is diminishing while popularity and demand for them is increasing. They are always going to make sleeker, faster, stronger cars as time goes on, but they can't remake the gems of the past.

           Background Information
        </h3>
        <p>
            JDM cars began to take hold in the late '80s when car enthusiasts started to notice Japan's sports cars. At the beginning, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Suzuki, and Honda were the top competitors for Japanese made vehicles. There were, however, many more makes and models that started to jump onto the scene. Some examples are Toyota, Mazda, Lexus, Subaru, and Infinity. These may be names that you have heard quite frequently, but all of these brands started out in Japan and have evolved into what they are today.

            Brand Information
        </h3>
        <p>
            Back in the '80s and '90s there were several brands that reigned when it came to JDM vehicles. Those brands were Honda, Toyota, and Nissan. The brand Honda first started out as a bicycle with a motor on it. They then transformed it into a motorcycle, and later went on to manufacture cars and sports cars. Honda was the first Japanese manufacturer to produce vehicles in North America. They then progressed into making faster and more reliable vehicles and now we see them as one of the top manufactures in the world. Toyota started back in 1933 and produced their first car, the Model AA sedan, in 1936. In 1957 they established Toyota Motor Sales in the U.S.A. In the late '80s and early '90s they grew significantly due to the innovation of their luxury brand Lexus, and the hybrid-vehicle the Prius. They have now also become one of the top manufacturers around the world and continue to make amazing innovations. Lastly, there is Nissan. Nissan was also founded in 1933 in Japan. They didn't move to the U.S. until 1958, but while they were still in Japan they made one of the most sought after JDM vehicles. The Nissan Skyline. They continued to innovate and produce many well made vehicles in the U.S. as well as in Japan. Nissan is now one of the top competitors around the world.

            Purpose of JDM Cars
        </h3>
        <p>
            JDM vehicles were meant to be high-performance cars that were capable of drifting and racing around of the streets of Japan. These cars aren't just for looks, they are customized to look and perform at the level the owner desires. Many of which desire extremely high power machines that can tear up the road and assure victory in a race. The essence of a JDM car is to take a massed produced vehicle and make it one of a kind through modifications and a lot of hard work. Now-a-days many people all over the world seek out the “gems” in the JDM industry so they can turn them into a one-of-a-kind beauty.
